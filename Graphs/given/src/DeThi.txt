        f1()
         * Question: Perform breadth-first search on the graph.
         * Starting from the vertex C (which index is 2), ONLY display the vertex right after C up to the next 4 vertices. 
         * Hint: copy breadth(...) to breadth_2(...) and modify the method breadth_2(...) appropriately.
         * The output f1() will be written into file 'f1.txt'. 
         * Therefore you should open this file to see/test your code output.
         * Example: With the graph provided in 'data.txt', the content of 'f1.txt' after running this method is 
         *          C  F  H  B  E  I  A  D  G
         *          F  H  B  E
